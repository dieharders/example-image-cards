# Image Cards
A small example page demonstrating how to load externally hosted images and display various sized photos in a container with defined size.

## ![Live Demo](https://example-image-cards.firebaseapp.com/)

## What it does:
- Query the Unsplash API to fetch random photos.
- Construct & style DOM elements using info supplied in JSON response.
- Smart resize images to completely fill the container.
- Make containers responsive to window size.
- (Graceful loading) Lays out all html elements even before images finish loading.
- Fade-in photos once they finish loading.
- Hove over effects (hide overlay and descriptions).
